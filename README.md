**Introduction**

This is a blogging application made using flask (python) and sqlite3 for the database. 
This implementation is SEO friendly because it creates the html files for each blog post.

**How it works**

You have a login screen, a dashboard for creating blogs and a bloglist page to list the blogs you have created.
You can have multiple admins stored in the database.

**How to host it**

You can host this as an application on any python compatible system, a perfect example is *pythonanywhere.com*.
on *app.py*, edit the name for the name of your blog, admin name and password also and deploy it. You can also
style it to your taste using css and html.
